1.It would have taken a lot of time, for this particular assignment it may be a reasonable amount of time,
but for bigger volumes of data to look at we wouldn't be able to finish in a lifetime.

2.Our conclusion is that a program of this kind is best suited for situations when we need to cover big volumes of data in order to 
look for specific information (key words,stats,targeted inormation).

3.For repeating the program every hour, we would need to add a watch command that allows to execute the program priodically, to avoid using already used articles 
we must store the used articles in a file and compare it with the results of our search.
